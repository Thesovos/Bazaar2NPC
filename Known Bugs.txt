Next Quick has issues at a known point 
	not sure if work around or actual fix


I haven't coded any way to stop music yet 
	not eactly a bug but its an issue
		it stops when you exit

Values are often wrong but seem to match the API from what I can tell 
	Check https://api.hypixel.net/skyblock/bazaar for raw data to compare
		a lot of things are named silly but theres a list of alises in settings.ini
			I use the "quick_status" to anchor my regex matches so the prices after the last/third time an item is mentioned are the ones the tool should be useing

Settings is a work in progress
	Settings.ini edits should work
		the home button app side works and the combo box calls the right data for the DDM half of things, thats about it.
			Assume in tool settings page is buged
