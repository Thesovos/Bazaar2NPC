Next Quick has issues at a known point 
	not sure if work around or actual fix


I haven't coded any way to stop music yet 
	not eactly a bug but its an issue, if you close and open again it stops

Values are often wrong but seem to match the API from what I can tell 
	Check https://api.hypixel.net/skyblock/bazaar for raw data to compare
		a lot of things are named silly but theres a list of alises in settings.ini
			I use the "quick_status" to anchor my regex matches so the prices after the last/third time an item is mentioned are the ones the tool should be useing

Settings is a work in progress
	Nothing works
		Well the home button works and theres some data processing that works but it is a bug
			Assume settings is buged
